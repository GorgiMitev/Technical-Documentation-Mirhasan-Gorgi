      <h1>Introduction</h1>
    </header>

    <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
      It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment
      (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
      its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
    </p>


    <code>if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }</code>

    <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date,
      and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control
      structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a
      variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for
      example:
    </p>

    <ul>

      <li> Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
        to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example,
        client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an
        HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input,
        and page navigation.
      </li>

      <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
        relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side
        extensions allow an application to communicate with a database,
        provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of
        the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
      </li>

    </ul>

      <h1>What you should already know?</h1>
    </header>

    <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>

    <code>function square(number) { return number * number; }</code>

    <p>Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global variables using the window.variable syntax.</p>

    <ul>

      <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</li>
      <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>

    </ul>

  </section>



  <section id="JavaScript_and_Java" class="main-section">
    <header>
      <h1>JavaScript and Java</h1>
    </header>

    <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax,
      naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>

    <code>const PI = 3.14; </code>

    <p>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not have to
      implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Boolean. true and false.
      </li>
      <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.
      </li>
    </ul>

  </section>


  <section id="Hello_World" class="main-section">
    <header>
      <h1>Hello World</h1>
    </header>

    <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
    </p>
    <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
      greetMe("World");
    </code>

    <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.
      </li>
      <li>String. "Howdy"
      </li>
    </ul>

  </section>


  <section id="Variables" class="main-section">
    <header>
      <h1>Variables</h1>
    </header>

    <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
    </p>
    <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5
    </code>
    <ul>
      <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.
      </li>
      <li>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.
      </li>
    </ul>
